# Home Automation

Home Automation is a distributed smart home system largely written in Go[<sup>1</sup>](#1).
It's mostly meant as a learning opportunity rather than a production-ready system.

## Currently supported services

| Service | Description |Â Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| service.controller.aurora | A controller for Nanoleaf Aurora lightpanels      | Alpha |
| service.controller.sonoff | A controller for sonoff tasmota lights and plugs  | Alpha |
| service.controller.sonos  | A controller for all types of sonos speakers      | WIP   |
| service.controller.hue    | tbd | Planned |

## Usage

All responses will be JSON. Individual service's README's will detail the expected JSON value.
Start all docker containers with: `docker-compose up -d --build --force-recreate`

### API Gateway Service

The api gateway service reads data from `service.api-gateway/config.yaml` and distributes requests accordingly.
Example config.yaml structure:
```yaml
port: 4000

services:
    service.device-registry:
        name: Device Registry
        prefix: service.device-registry
        upstream: "http://192.168.2.117:4001"
    service.controller.sonoff:
        name: Sonoff Controller
        prefix: service.controller.sonoff
        upstream: "http://192.168.2.117:4002"
    service.controller.sonos:
        name: Sonos Controller
        prefix: service.controller.sonos
        upstream: "http://192.168.2.117:4003"
```

### Controllers

Controllers must implement a standardised interface for fetching and updating device state.

`GET service.controller.<controller-identifier>/device/<device-identifier>`

- 200: success

```json
{
    "id": "lightpanels",
    "name": "Desk Lamp",
    "type": "lamp-color",
    "controller": "service.controller.aurora",
    "state": {
        "brightness": {
            "value": 50,
            "max": 100,
            "min": 0
        },
        "color_mode": "hs",
        "temperature": {
            "value": 4000,
            "max": 6500,
            "min": 1200
        },
        "hue": {
            "value": 123,
            "max": 360,
            "min": 0
        },
        "power": true,
        "saturation": {
            "value": 100,
            "max": 100,
            "min": 0
        }
    }
}
```

```json
{
  "identifier": "bedroom-plug",
  "name": "Bedroom Plug",
  "type": "plug",
  "controller": "service.controller.hue",
  "state": {
    "power": true
  }
}
```

`PUT service.controller.<controller-identifier>/device/<device-identifier>`

- JSON body:

```json
{
    "power": true,
    "brightness": {
        "value": 100,
        "duration": 10
    }
}
```

- 204: success

### Errors

An error will be indicated by a non-2xx status code. The response will include a message.

```json
{
  "message": "Description of what went wrong"
}
```
